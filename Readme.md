Date input via select fields
============================

Works with ISO 8601 date strings (YYYY-MM-DD).

Its advised not to use this directive on an input or select element to avoid confict regarding ngModel.$render.

This directive creates a new scope, so remember the best practice of always having a dot in your ng-model attrs.
